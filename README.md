# CUTLASS SYCL 0.3 (Base - CUTLASS 3.9.2)

**This repository fast-follows NVIDIA CUTLASS repository adding SYCL support for Intel GPUs.**

**For SYCL support instructions, refer to the [SYCL build documentation](./media/docs/cpp/build/building_with_sycl_support.md)**

[![OpenSSF Scorecard](https://api.scorecard.dev/projects/github.com/intel/cutlass-sycl/badge)](https://scorecard.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/intel/cutlass-sycl)

CUTLASS‑SYCL is a modular, header‑only C++ template framework for high‑performance 
GEMM, and fused epilogue kernels. It applies hierarchical tiling, composable policy 
abstractions, and efficient data‑movement primitives to build flexible, reusable 
building blocks for dense linear algebra. The SYCL implementation brings those 
optimizations to Intel GPUs with tuned kernels for modern execution units and memory 
hierarchies. It adds mixed‑precision and epilogue fusion pathways designed to 
simplify integrating advanced quantization and post‑processing into custom pipelines.

To support a wide variety of applications, CUTLASS-SYCL provides extensive
support for mixed-precision computations on Intel hardware, providing
specialized data-movement and multiply-accumulate abstractions for FP64, FP32,
FP16, BF16, 8b floating point types (E5M2 and E4M3 for FP8), narrow integer
types (4 and 8b signed and unsigned integers with support for zero-point
quantization), and mixed-precision operations with tensor-wise, channel-wise,
and group-wise quantization support. CUTLASS-SYCL demonstrates optimal matrix
multiply operations targeting Intel's programmable, high-throughput execution
units implemented in Intel Data Center GPU Max/Flex Series (Intel Xe
architecture, codename: Ponte-Vecchio) and Intel Arc B580 GPUs.

See the [Quick Start Guide](./media/docs/cpp/quickstart.md) to get started quickly.

See the [functionality docs](./media/docs/cpp/functionality.md) for a more comprehensive
list of kernel level features, data types, instructions, and minimum supported by CUTLASS on each GPU
architecture.

# CuTe

CUTLASS-SYCL supports the newly introducted core library, CuTe, to describe and manipulate tensors of threads and data.
CuTe in CUTLASS-SYCL is a collection of C++ SYCL template abstractions for
defining and operating on hierarchically multidimensional layouts of threads and data.
CuTe provides `Layout` and `Tensor` objects that compactly package the type,
shape, memory space, and layout of data, while performing the complicated indexing for the user.
This lets programmers focus on the logical descriptions of their algorithms while
CuTe does the mechanical bookkeeping for them. With these tools, we can quickly design,
implement, and modify all dense linear algebra operations.

The core abstractions of CuTe are hierarchically multidimensional layouts
which can be composed with data arrays to represent tensors.
The representation of layouts is powerful enough to represent nearly
everything we need to implement efficient dense linear algebra.
Layouts can also be combined and manipulated via functional composition, on which we build a large set of common operations such as tiling and partitioning.

CUTLASS-SYCL and beyond adopts CuTe throughout the GEMM hierarchy in its templates.
This greatly simplifies the design and improves code composability and readability.
More documentation specific to CuTe can be found in its
[dedicated documentation directory](./media/docs/cpp/cute/00_quickstart.md).

# Building CUTLASS

CUTLASS is a header-only template library and does not need to be built to be used by other
projects. Client applications should target CUTLASS's `include/` directory in their include
paths.

CUTLASS unit tests, examples, and utilities can be build with CMake.
The minimum version of CMake is given in the [Quickstart guide](./media/docs/cpp/quickstart.md).
Make sure the `CUDACXX` environment  variable points to NVCC in the CUDA Toolkit installed
on your system.

```bash
$ export CUDACXX=${CUDA_INSTALL_PATH}/bin/nvcc
```

Create a build directory within the CUTLASS project, then run CMake. By default CUTLASS will build kernels
for CUDA architecture versions 5.0, 6.0, 6.1, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.6, 8.9, and 9.0.
To reduce compile time you can specify
the architectures to build CUTLASS for by changing the CMake configuration setting
`CUTLASS_NVCC_ARCHS`.

```bash
$ mkdir build && cd build

$ cmake .. -DCUTLASS_NVCC_ARCHS=80               # compiles for NVIDIA's Ampere Architecture
```

From the `build/` directory, compile and run the CUTLASS unit tests by building the target `test_unit` with make.

The unit tests are organized as several binaries mirroring the top-level namespaces of CUTLASS,
and they may be executed in parallel via make's `-j` command line argument.

```bash
$ make test_unit -j
...
...
...
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 946 tests from 57 test cases ran. (10812 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 946 tests.
```

All tests should pass on supported platforms, though the exact number of tests may vary over time.


# Project Structure

CUTLASS is arranged as a header-only library along with Utilities, Tools, Examples, and unit tests.
